Align file names to 96-well plate
=================================

When we submit 96-well plates for sequencing to the NGS facility, we typically 
submit something like an Excel sheet giving rows/columns of the plate and the
biological sample that should be in each well. What we get back from the NGS
facility is a mass of bam or fastq files.
