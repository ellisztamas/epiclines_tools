Welcome to epiclinestools's documentation!
======================================

``epiclinestools`` is a hodgepodge of Python functions to automate various bioinformatics 
tasks related to bisulphite-converted sequence data. This was written as part
of the Epiclines ERC project awarded to Magnus Nordborg at the Gregor Mendel 
Institute in Vienna.It was designed primarily for internal use and may well make
no sense at all to anyone outside the group.
