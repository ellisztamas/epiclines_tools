# methlab

## A class for disecting allc files

25th July 2023

Created a class to import and take apart cytosine coverage files from Bismark.

* `count_reads` counts up methylated and unmethylated reads, plus total number
    of cytosines in each sequence context.
* `methylation_over_features` takes series of genome coordinates (from an
    annotation file, for example), pulls out each part of the coverage file and
    calls `count_reads` on each.
* `conversion_rate` calculates mean methylation on each chromosome
* `methylation_in_windows` partitions the genome in to windows of fixed size and
    calls `count_reads` on each.

Added test data and a test file.

Updated to v0.2.2

## Renamed to methlab to conform to Python standards

20th July 2023

Corrected how versioning is done - this ought to be done in __init__.py and be imported to setup.py
I'm not really sure what setup.cfg is doing.
